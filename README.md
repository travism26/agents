# agents

These are some agents i created for fun I would say the one that works the best is [Cover Letter Writer](https://github.com/travism26/agents/tree/main/agentic_coverletter_creator) There is NO UI I would like to have one but time is limited I am open for PR's.

One document that I found helpful when building agentic systems is: [LLM-Workflows](https://github.com/travism26/agents/blob/main/agentic_coverletter_creator/agents_llmworkflow.md) its withing the cover letter creator sub project

## Agents available and keys required

I created 3 agents cover letter is prob my favorite once does few things 

1. Creates 2 cover letters, plus if you have perplexity api key, it does research on the company and comes up with questions to ask / prep material
  a. Table based cover letter
  b. Regular version 3-4 paragraphs
3. Creates questions to prep for before the interview.
