# Cover Letter Generation Agent Active Tasks

## Current Sprint: Sprint 1

Start Date: 2025-02-28
End Date: 2025-03-14

## Project Description

The Cover Letter Generation Agent is an agentic system that automates the creation of personalized cover letters by leveraging AI-driven research, content drafting, and evaluation. The system uses three specialized agents (Research, Writer, and Evaluator) working together in an orchestrator-workers pattern to produce high-quality, personalized cover letters.
